Direct Addressing: The address field contains the memory address of the operand. The contents at that address are loaded into the ACC (Accumulator).
Indirect Addressing: The address field points to a memory location that contains the address of the operand. The contents at that second address are loaded into the ACC.
Indexed Addressing: The effective address is calculated by adding the value in the Index Register (IR) to the address part of the instruction. The operand at that calculated address is then accessed.
Relative Addressing: The effective address is determined by adding an offset to the current value of the Program Counter (PC). This allows for relocatable code and is commonly used in branching.
Conditional Jump: The jump to another instruction occurs only if a specific condition is true (e.g., result of a comparison). It's like using an if statement.
Unconditional Jump: The program control always jumps to the specified address without checking any condition.
